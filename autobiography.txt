Autobiography

I am a student with an international educational background. During my high school years, I chose to study at Cotter High School in the United States. This experience not only exposed me to different educational cultures but also helped me develop independence and self-reliance. While studying in the U.S., I had to adapt to an all-English learning environment and learn to take care of myself in a foreign country, experiences that have made me more mature and responsible.

During my time at Cotter High School, I actively participated in various school activities and interacted with students from different countries. This experience broadened my international perspective and taught me how to interact with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. Academically, I worked hard to overcome language barriers, diligently studied various subjects, and participated in extracurricular activities to develop diverse interests.

After graduating from high school, I chose to return to Taiwan to continue my education. This decision allowed me to combine the international perspective gained from my American education with my understanding of Taiwanese culture. During my university years, I maintained an active learning attitude and applied my international experiences to my studies and daily life.
